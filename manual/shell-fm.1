.TH "shell-fm" 1
.SH NAME
Shell.FM \- Lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio streams.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell-fm
[-d] [-i address] [-p port] [-b] [-D device] [-y proxy] [-h] lastfm://...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell.FM is a lightweight, console-based player for radio streams provided by
Last.FM.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Fork to background (requires a socket interface to be set up so it can still be
controlled somehow).
.TP
.B \-i <address>
Enable the socket interface and bind it to the given host address (should be
the host name or IP address of the host shell-fm is running on).
.TP
.B \-p <port>
Make the socket interface listen for incoming connections on the given port.
Default is 54311.
.TP
.B \-b
Enable batch mode (some freaky mode that makes shell-fm easier to handle from
inside emacs). This was not my idea.
.TP
.B \-D <device>
Use the given device file as audio device. This is only used if libao support
is disabled. Default is /dev/audio.
.TP
.B \-y <proxy>
Make shell-fm use the given host as proxy server for HTTP requests.
.TP
.B \-h
Print help text and exit.
.TP
.B lastfm://...
URI of a Last.FM radio stream to play after startup. 
For example: `shell-fm -d lastfm://artist/The%20Beatles/similarartists'
.SH USAGE
On startup, shell-fm will ask you for your Last.FM login and password
(if not
provided in your ~/.shell-fm/shell-fm.rc). If you've given a stream URI on the
command line or there is a default radio defined in the configuration file,
shell-fm will now try to play it. When the startup is done, there are lots of
keys to control shell-fm. Here is a alphabetically sorted list.
.TP
.B a
Add the currently played track to your Last.FM playlist.
.TP
.B A
Ban the artist of the currently played track. Whenever a track of that artist
is played from now on, it is automatically banned.
.TP
.B B
Ban the currently played track.
.TP
.B d
Enabled/disable discovery mode. I'm not sure if this has any effect, and it
looks like even the Last.FM guys don't really know what it does, but I think it
is meant to ensure that you get only tracks that you don't know yet.
.TP
.B f
Jump to the fan radio station of the artist of the currently played track.
.TP
.B h
List bookmarks.
.TP
.B H
Bookmark the currently played radio station. You'll be asked to hit a digit
key. Whenever you hit that key again from now on, shell-fm will jump to that
radio station.
.TP
.B i
Print some more information about the currently played track.
.TP
.B l
Love the currently played track.
.TP
.B n
Skip the currently played track.
.TP
.B p
Pause. If you pause too long, the stream will break, which has the same effect
as stopping the stream (see below).
.TP
.B P
Enable/disable reporting played tracks to your Last.FM profile. Enabled by default.
.TP
.B Q
Quit.
.TP
.B r
Change radio station. This will prompt you for an Last.FM radio station URI.
The tabulator key helps if you don't know what to type. Arrow-Up and Arrow-Down
allow you to browse your radio history. Enter these without the
"lastfm://" prefix. 
.RS
.PP
For example: `radio url> globaltags/world'
.RE
.TP
.B R
Recommend the currently played track/artist/album to another Last.FM user.
.TP
.B S
Stop playing.
.TP
.B s
Jump to the similar artists radio stream of the currently played tracks artist.
.TP
.B T
Tag the currently played track/artist/album. Tabulator key completes known
tags.
.TP
.B +
Increase volume (vol).
.TP
.B *
Increase volume (pcm).
.TP
.B -
Decrease volume (vol).
.TP
.B /
Decrease volume (pcm).
.PP
.SH SETUP
Before you start, you should have created the directories
.B ~/.shell-fm
and
.B ~/.shell-fm/cache
or you will get a lot of warnings, the tab-completion will be extremely
slow and you can't make use of some features (auto-ban, history, bookmarks).
You might also want to place a configuration file in
.B ~/.shell-fm
for a faster startup.
.SH CONFIGURATION
This section describes the syntax and options for the shell-fm configuration
file. The file should be placed in
.B ~/.shell-fm/shell-fm.rc
and should consist of simple
.B key = value
assignments.
See (far) below for a sample configuration. These are the available options.
.TP
.B username = your-login
This is your login on Last.FM. If this is provided, shell-fm won't ask you for
it on startup anymore.
.TP
.B password = your-password
This is your (clear text) Last.FM password. If this and your login is provided
in the configuration, shell-fm won't ask you on startup.
.TP
.B default-radio = lastfm://...
If this is provided (and valid), shell-fm will play this station by default
after startup. If there's another station URI given on the command line, it
will override this setting.
.TP
.B np-file = path-to-file
If this is defined, shell-fm will print information about the currently played
track into the given file, whenever a new track is played.
.TP
.B np-file-format = format-string
This defines how the information written to your now-playing file will look
like. There are several format flags available. Have a look at the
.B FORMAT FLAGS
section for the details.
.TP
.B np-cmd = shell command
If this is defined, the given command will be execute whenever a new track
starts. The value may contain format flags.
.TP
.B ?-color = color
This allows you to color format elements. The
.B ?
may be the letter of any format flag (without percent). The color is just a
normal shell color code matching "[01];3[0-7]". Whenever the format element is
printed to the console, it will have the given color. Have a look at the
.B COLORS
section for a list.
.TP
.B key0x?? = shell command
This allows you to bind shell commands to free keys (keys that are not used by
shell-fm, check the
.B USAGE
section above for a list).
.B ??
should be the hex code of the ASCII code of the key. The command you assign
will be evaluated (check the
.B FORMAT FLAGS
section) and executed then. This "feature" allows you to implement own
features, like fetching and printing the lyrics of the currently played track,
etc. If you have a cool idea or even a working script, I'd be happy if you let
me know.
.TP
.B bind = host
This specifies the network interface you want shell-fm to bind to.
.B host
should be the host name or an IP address of host shell-fm is running on.
shell-fm will open a port (see the
.B port
option below) on the specified interface which you can connect to to control
shell-fm remotely (or from local scripts, see
.B key0x??
above). Check the
.B NETWORK INTERFACE COMMANDS
section below for a list of known commands.
.TP
.B port = port-number
With this option you can change the port shell-fm will listen on (if
.B bind
is specified). Default is 54311.
.TP
.B extern = shell command
This allows you to specify an external program or script as player for the
streams. If given, shell-fm will run the command and pipe the MP3 stream into
it, instead of playing the stream itself. For example,
.B extern = madplay -Q -
works very fine. This option is meant as a work-around for architectures that
shell-fm doesn't work completly profectly on.
.TP
.B proxy = proxy server
This allows you to specify a proxy server for the HTTP requests.
.TP
.B expiry = some-number
This defines the number of seconds until a cached page expires. The default is
86400 seconds (24 hours). You shouldn't set a very low value here, since the
Last.FM server often are very slow. This mostly affects the prompts (radio
prompt, tag prompt, ...), since shell-fm fetches some feeds to get values for
the tab-completion.
.TP
.B device = path
Path to the audio device to use (see
.B -D
command line option).
.TP
.B title-format = format-string
This is the format of the track string that is printed to the console for every
track played. Default is 'Now playing "%t" by %a.'.
.TP
.B minimum = percentage
With this option you can change the minimum duration a track must have been
played to be scrobbled (in percent, but without the % sign). For example, if
this option is set to 75, the track will not be scrobbled if it has not been
played for at least 75% of its total duration. If you skip or stop the track
before it has been played for 75%, it will not be scrobbled. Default is 50%, as
specified in the scrobbling protocol version 1.2.
.TP
.B delay-change = something
If this is set to anything, and you change the station with 'r', 's' or 'f',
the station-change will be delayed until the currently played track finishes or
is skipped. Also they key 'q' will initialize a delayed quit, so after the
currently played track shell-fm will exit. 'Q' (uppercase) still quits
immediately.
.TP
.B screen-format = format-string
If this is set, shell-fm will check if the terminal it's running in is a screen
session ($TERM is "screen") and set the screen windows title to the formatted
string to be seen on $ESCAPE+w or $ESCAPE+".
.TP
.B term-format = format-string
Works like screen-format, but sets the x-terminals window title.
.TP
.B download = format-string
If this is set to a valid path (may contain format flags), and the played track
is free, it is saved at the given place.
.TP
.B gap = seconds
If this is set to a number, shell-fm will wait that amount of seconds between
tracks.
.SH FORMAT FLAGS
There are several format flags allowed for some options. Here is the list.
.TP
.B %a
Artist name.
.TP

.SH NETWORK INTERFACE COMMANDS
This section describes the commands shell-fm's network interface knows. To use
the interface, you must provide a valid value to the
.B bind
option in your configuration or use the
.B -i
option on the command line. Then you can connect the specified port (54311 by
default) and send one command at a time. You also have to hurry,
since there is a very short timeout. Best thing would be if you used a script
for accessing this interface. (See 
.B shell-fm-*/scripts/
for examples) This is a list of the known commands.
